# COMP-1327 Assignment 1
## Description
In this project I am demonstrating my understanding of:
- Setting up a project.
- Initializing a repository.
- Performing version control (Git) tasks.
## Author
Karan Singh Bhullar
## First git status output
No commits yet
## Second git status output
nothing to commit, working tree clean
## Purpose of the following Commands
- `mkdir`: to create new empty directories in the specified location
- `cd`: to change the current working directory
- `code`: to launch VS code
- `ls`: to display files and directories
## Why Version Control is Important
With version control, it is possible to:
- Keep track of changes
- find the previous version
## Purpose of the following Git Commands
- `git init`: to create a new Git repository
- `git status`: to check which changes have been staged.
- `git add`: to tell Git which files or changes you want to include in next command.
- `git commit`: Records changes to the local repository.
- `git push`: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.
- `git log`: Shows a history of commits in the repository.
- `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
- `git merge`: Combines changes from one branch into another.
- `git checkout`: Switches between branches or restores files from a branch or commit. 
## My Unique Touch
There are things that set me apart from others:
- I am energetic
- I am supportive
